# exercise-04 What kind of Triangle?

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter the three lengths of a triangle (one at a time):
#      Enter the lengths of three side of a triangle:
#      a: 
#      b:
#      c:
# 2. Write the code that determines if the triangle is:
#      equalateral - all three sides are equal in length
#      scalene - all three sides are unequal in length
#      isosceles - two sides are the same length
# 3. Print a message such as:
#      - A triangle with sides of <a>, <b> & <c> is a <type of triangle> triangle

print("Enter the 3 side lengths of a triangle: ")
a = int(input("a: "))
b = int(input("b: "))
c = int(input("c: "))
print(a, b, c)

def define_triangle(a,b,c):
    if(a == b) and (b == c):
        print("equalateral")
    elif a != b and b != c and a != c:
        print("scalene")
    else:
        print("isosceles")
        
define_triangle(a,b,c)
